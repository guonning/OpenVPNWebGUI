2. Install the program using all the defaults (Click Next, Install, etc)
3. If you receive an error, click Continue Anyway
4. Finish the Installation
5. Click the Start Button->All Programs->OpenVPN->OpenVPN configuration file directory
6. Copy all the files in the zip file (not the folder, the files) into the folder that just popped up.
7. Right Click on the OpenVPN icon in the taskbar (It looks like two computers with a red screen.) Click on Connect.
8. You should be connected after a few seconds. This will only work while you are connected to the Internet outside the district, and will not work very well on a slow connection.

Note: If you are on Windows Vista or Windows 7 you need to right-click on the client in the taskbar and exit it. Then go to the client in the start menu and right-click on it. Select Run as Administrator and continue with the instructions.
